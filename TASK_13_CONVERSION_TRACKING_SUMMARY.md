## Technical Details

### Database Queries
The analytics endpoint uses optimized SQL queries with:
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, ROUND)
- Conditional aggregation (CASE WHEN)
- Date formatting (DATE_FORMAT)
- Grouping and ordering
- Proper NULL handling (NULLIF)

### Security
- All analytics endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access control (super_admin, admin, hr_manager)
- Rate limiting applied
- Error logging for debugging

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient SQL queries with proper indexes
- Limited result sets (e.g., last 10 conversions, last 12 months)
- Client-side caching of analytics data
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## User Experience

   - Can reverse if marked incorrectly

3. **Analyze Performance:**
