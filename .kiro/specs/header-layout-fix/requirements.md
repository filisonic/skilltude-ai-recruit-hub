# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The website currently has a layout issue where the fixed header overlaps the content on pages like Blog and Contact. Users report that the top content gets cut off and is only revealed when dragging the mouse down forcefully. This creates a poor user experience and makes the content inaccessible without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see all page content without it being hidden behind the header, so that I can access information immediately without having to scroll or drag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the page content SHALL be fully visible below the fixed header
2. WHEN the header changes height due to scroll state THEN the page content SHALL remain properly positioned
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the content SHALL be properly spaced regardless of header height variations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent layout system that accounts for the fixed header, so that all pages display content correctly without manual adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new pages THEN the layout system SHALL automatically handle header spacing
2. WHEN the header height changes (scrolled vs non-scrolled state) THEN the content positioning SHALL adapt accordingly
3. IF the header component is modified THEN existing pages SHALL continue to display correctly without additional changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want consistent content visibility across desktop and mobile, so that the experience is seamless regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the content SHALL be positioned correctly below the header
2. WHEN viewing on mobile with the mobile menu open THEN the content SHALL not be obscured
3. WHEN the mobile menu is toggled THEN the content positioning SHALL remain stable
