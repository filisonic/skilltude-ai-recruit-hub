## Tips for Improving Your CV Before Submission

Want to get the best possible score? Follow these tips before submitting:

### Content Tips

- Avoid: Responsible for, Worked on, Helped with

**2. Quantify Your Achievements**

- Not: "Improved sales performance"

**3. Tailor to Your Target Role**
- Include relevant keywords from job descriptions
- Highlight skills that match the position
- Remove irrelevant experience

**4. Write a Strong Professional Summary**
- 3-4 sentences at the top of your CV
- Highlight your key skills and experience
- Include your career goals or value proposition

**5. Include a Comprehensive Skills Section**
- List technical skills, software, and tools
- Include soft skills (leadership, communication)
- Organize by category if you have many skills

### Formatting Tips

**1. Keep It Simple**
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
