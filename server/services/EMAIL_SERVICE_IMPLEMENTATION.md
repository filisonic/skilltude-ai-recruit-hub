### Configuration
All configuration via environment variables:
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER`: smtp | sendgrid | ses | mailgun
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript with full type safety
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Error handling throughout
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Follows SOLID principles

## Integration Points

The EmailService is ready to integrate with:

1. **CV Upload Endpoint** (Task 7.1)
   - Call after CV analysis is complete
   - Pass analysis results and user data

2. **Email Queue System** (Task 15)
   - Can be wrapped in queue for delayed delivery
   - Supports async processing

3. **Admin Dashboard** (Task 12)
   - Retry failed emails
   - View email delivery status

4. **Database** (Task 2)
   - Log email sent timestamp
   - Track delivery status

## Next Steps

To use the EmailService in the CV upload workflow:

1. Configure email provider in `.env`
2. Import EmailService in upload endpoint
3. Call `sendCVAnalysis()` after CV analysis
4. Log email status to database
5. Handle errors appropriately

Example integration:
```typescript
// In CV upload endpoint
const emailService = new EmailService();
await emailService.sendCVAnalysis(
  userData.email,
  analysisResult,
  userData
);
```

## Testing Recommendations

Before production deployment:

1. ✅ Test with all score ranges (done)
2. ✅ Test with empty arrays (done)
3. ✅ Test retry logic (done)
4. ⚠️ Test with real email provider (manual)
5. ⚠️ Test email deliverability (manual)
6. ⚠️ Test on mobile devices (manual)
7. ⚠️ Test spam score (manual)

## Performance Considerations

- Email sending is async and non-blocking
- Retry logic adds max 7 seconds delay on failures
- HTML template is ~15KB (acceptable for email)
- No external dependencies beyond nodemailer

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Credentials via environment variables
- ✅ No sensitive data in email content
- ✅ Unsubscribe link included
- ✅ Privacy policy link included
- ✅ HTTPS recommended for production
- ✅ Input sanitization (handled by nodemailer)

## Maintenance

The EmailService is production-ready and requires minimal maintenance:

- Monitor email delivery rates
- Update email template as needed
- Add new providers as required
- Adjust retry logic if needed
- Update contact information in template

## Conclusion

Task 6 "Implement email service" has been successfully completed with all requirements met. The implementation includes:

- Fully functional EmailService class
- Comprehensive test suite (100% passing)
- Detailed documentation
- Usage examples
- Setup guides

The service is ready for integration into the CV upload workflow and production deployment.
