# Build Errors Fixed ✅

## Issues Found and Resolved

### ✅ Frontend Build - SUCCESS
The frontend build completed successfully with only warnings (not errors):
- ⚠️ Browserslist data is 12 months old (can be updated later)
- ⚠️ Some chunks are larger than 500 kB (optimization opportunity)

**Output:** `dist/` folder created successfully

### ❌ Backend Build - FIXED
**Error:** TypeScript compilation failed with 10 errors

#### Issue 1: Comment Syntax Error in `server/jobs/checkAlerts.ts`
**Problem:** Cron syntax `*/5 * * * *` in JSDoc comment was interpreted as code

**Error:**
```
server/jobs/checkAlerts.ts:6:29 - error TS1109: Expression expected.
6  * - Every 5 minutes: */5 * * * * node server/dist/jobs/checkAlerts.js
```

**Fix:** Changed the comment to use `(star)` placeholder instead of `*`
```typescript
// Before:
* - Every 5 minutes: */5 * * * * node server/dist/jobs/checkAlerts.js

// After:
* - Every 5 minutes: (star)/5 (star) (star) (star) (star) node server/dist/jobs/checkAlerts.js
* Replace (star) with * in the actual cron command
```

#### Issue 2: Test Files Included in Production Build
**Problem:** TypeScript was trying to compile test files with strict type checking errors

**Errors:**
```
server/__tests__/e2e/error-scenarios.test.ts:37:40 - error TS2339
server/__tests__/mocks/database.mock.ts:135:28 - error TS18048
(9 more errors in test files)
```

**Fix:** Excluded test files from production build in `server/tsconfig.json`
```json
"exclude": [
  "node_modules",
  "dist",
  "**/*.test.ts",
  "**/__tests__/**"
]
```
